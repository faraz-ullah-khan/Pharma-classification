# Pharma-classification

This is the project which is done while pursuing the data science corse
Got an knowledg and some experience by building this project

We can pridict the liver dieases thorugh this model 
Build a predictive model using various blood and urine measurements (e.g., albumin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, bilirubin).
Ensure high accuracy and reliability in identifying early signs of liver disease.
Liver disease can lead to serious health problems and increased treatment costs if not detected early. A healthcare institution plans to use data science to develop a classification model that predicts liver disease from patient medical data, helping clinicians with early diagnosis and personalized treatment.
